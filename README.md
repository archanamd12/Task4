#  Simple Responsive Landing Page

This project was originally created as part of a previous task to build a basic desktop-only landing page using HTML and CSS. 

As part of this task, it has now been enhanced to be **mobile-friendly** using **CSS media queries**.

- Responsive layout using `@media (max-width: 600px)`
